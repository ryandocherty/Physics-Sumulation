# Physics Simulation Project

## Overview

The objective of this project is to introduce concepts of physics programming using the PhysX engine with C/C++. 
The project entails the development of a simple pool table simulation featuring snooker balls, allowing users to interact with the physics-based environment.

## Features

- **Realistic Physics Simulation**: Utilizes the PhysX engine to accurately simulate the interactions and movements of snooker balls on the pool table.
- **Interactive Environment**: Players can control the cue ball using keyboard inputs to strike other balls with realistic physics reactions.
- **Graphical Representation**: A simple graphical interface representing a pool table and snooker balls with on-screen feedback for interactions.
